    "##### Q4: General Weighted Linear Regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS, FGLS, and IV regression with 2SLS are all forms of general weighted linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of OLS, the weights T are 1 and do not vary by observation such that T'Y=T'XB + T'u is equivalent to the results of Y=XB+u for a given Y, X, B, and u. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of FGLS, the weights T are determined by variance-covariance matrix of the errors first produced by OLS, then leveraged to implement GLS. T is not random and is determined based on the covariance matrix of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In weighted 2SLS, the weights are determined by the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the instruments. We then conduct the second stage regression, with the weights determined based on the predicted values from the first stage analysis. Again, T here is not random and determined based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One estimator that is not a form of general weighted linear regression is a logit model, which cannot be written in the form of T'Y=T'XB+T'u. While weights can be factored into the log-likelihood function, the transformation of the equation to accommodate the binary outcome / avoid negative predicted values means that it does not belong in this class of regressions given by this equation."
